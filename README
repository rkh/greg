greg is a re-entrant peg/leg, with some bug fixes.

the most comprehensive example of greg usage is in
nagaqueen, an ooc grammar, used in rock, an ooc
compiler written in ooc.

This fork of greg supports the memorization of
failed rule application attempts.  For a language
with more elaborated syntax and operators, a PEG
parser can spend exponentially long time to try
the same rule application at the same input
location.  The typical solution for this problem
is to assume that a grammar rule always returns
the same result at the same location and remember
the value, effectively in the (location, rule_id)
2D table.

An interesting quirk that Ian's leg has is that it
defers the semantic action execution until the
system "commits" a successfull parse.  (That is
why putting printf() in a failed choice in a rule
does not show any debug log, BTW.)  Because of
this, a normal way of memorizing the results does
not work.  So, instead, this fork only remembers
the fact that the rule failed; next time it trys
the same rule at the location, it short-cuts the
work and fails.
